A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors
Proper positive divisors are positive integers that fully divide the perfect number without leaving a remainder and exclude the perfect number itself
For example, take the number 6:
Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3 (since 6 is the value of the perfect number, it is excluded), and the sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
Therefore, 6 is a perfect number (as well as the first perfect number)
